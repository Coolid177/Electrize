# Electrize
This is a school project of a school app. It was an app that needed to serve as a shopping app where you can buy electric products as cheap as possible. It was made with Senne Bergmans and Lukas Mertens. The code isn't the cleanest as we were struggling to finish this project in only four days time (We already had the concept of the app). Most of the images are the same because we didn't have time to provide 10 different images for every product. The same goes for the profile pictures. The products, profiles and reviews where generated by chatgp

# Installation
The app was developed on android studio and is (as far as I know) for android devices. The minimum sdk is API 24: Android 7.0 (Nougat). According to android studio the app should run on 94.4% of android devices.

You can install the app by downloading and running the "app.apk".
